/*
Alien Colors #1: Imagine an alien was just shot down in a game. Create a
variable called alienColor and assign it a value of 'green', 'yellow', or 'red'.
• Write an if statement to test whether the alien’s color is green. If it is, print
a message that the player just earned 5 points.
• Write one version of this program that passes the if test and another that
fails. (The version that fails will have no output.)

var alienColor = "green"

if (alienColor == "green") {
    print("You Earned 5 points.")
} 

// Another version of the program that doesn't have any output
var alienColor2 = "yellow"

if (alienColor2 == "green") {
    print("You Earned 5 points.")
}
